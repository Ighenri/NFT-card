## My process
I began the project by laying my html structure to give in the necessary details. Afterwards, i outlined the css styles to be used then worked on each section one after the other.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

After the completion of the project, amidst the css syntaxes known to me, i learn using the hsl method of coloring and also i was able to use auto margin when i centered the NFT card
